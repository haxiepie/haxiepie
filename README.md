### skills (if you wanna call 'em that):
- python: i can print “hello world” and break stuff. not too shabby.
- javascript: slightly less painful (sometimes I make it do what I want) but still makes me question my life choices 
- roblox lua: why did i even start learning this? help.
- c: feels like a painful trip back to the stone age of programming, but here we are

### hobbies:
- writing code that definitely shouldn’t see the light of day
- staring at error messages and crying inside
- breaking things, then fixing 'em just enough to call it "debugged"
- pretending i know what i’m doing
- writing code that’s more “oops” than “oops, i did it again”
- writing code that works after 15-20 attempts. (10 on a good day.)


### goals:
- survive roblox lua without smashing my keyboard
- maybe not procrastinate learning c
- figure out why i didnt just try applying to the NFL
- stop crying over my code
