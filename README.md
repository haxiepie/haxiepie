loser degenerate who knows some python and javascript. currently learning roblox lua, not fun, learning c as well, who knew it was a bad idea to learn two languages at once? 

skills (if you wanna call 'em that):
- python: i can print “hello world” and break stuff. not too shabby.
- javascript: slightly less painful but still makes me question my life choices.
- roblox lua: why did i even start learning this? help.
- c: apparently, i hate myself enough to try.

### hobbies:
- writing code that somehow works… after 10 attempts
- staring at error messages and crying inside
- breaking things, then fixing 'em just enough to call it "debugged"
- pretending i know what i’m doing
- writing code that’s more “oops” than “oops, i did it again”


### goals:
- survive roblox lua without smashing my keyboard
- maybe not procrastinate learning c
- figure out why i didnt just try applying to the NFL.
